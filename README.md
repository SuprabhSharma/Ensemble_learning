This project demonstrates ensemble machine learning techniques using Python. It explores methods like bagging, boosting, and stacking to improve prediction accuracy by combining multiple models instead of relying on a single algorithm.

Tech Stack

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Scikit-learn / ML libraries

MySQL (if dataset stored in DB)

Key Objectives
